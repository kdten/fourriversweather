# Four Rivers Weather Web App
The goal with this design was to make a front end web presence that has extended usefulness past its inital visit. It was made from the ground up in order to practice various conecepts with the idea of an eventual Node backend written for its future features.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Making this project was a great learning experience from building the CSS grid with horizontal scroll functionality to coding out the Promise that handles the API calls. Responsiveness and adaptability to screen sizes was also at the top of our priorities and was accomplished with a mobile first design in mind.

## Optimizations

Converted initial callback APIs to Promise format to handle multiple asynchronous operations and provide better error handling. Replaced city entry form for automatic geolocation for local weather anywhere. In the future I will further uprgade the Promise structure to async await syntax.

## Lessons Learned:

The Javascript Promise was a great tool to have learned for future use.
