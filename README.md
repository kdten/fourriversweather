## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Making this project was a great learning experience from building the CSS grid with horizontal scroll functionality to coding out the Promise that handles the API calls. Responsiveness and adaptability to screen sizes was also at the top of our priorities and was accomplished with a mobile first design in mind.

## Optimizations
*Converted callback APIs to Promise format to handle multiple asynchronous operations and provide better error handling.
*Replaced city entry form for automatic geolocation for local weather anywhere.

## Lessons Learned:

The Javascript Promise was a great tool to have learned for future use.
